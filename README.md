Discrete-Time Survival Wide-and-Deep Learning

Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, necessitating improved prognostic tools for personalized treatment strategies. This study introduces a novel discrete-time survival wide-and-deep learning framework for predicting lung cancer patient survival using multi-source data. Our approach synergizes discrete-time survival models with wide-and-deep learning architectures to effectively integrate clinical variables, radiomic features, and raw CT images. The proposed model comprises a wide component that captures cross-product relationships with some linear transformations among clinical and radiomic features and a deep component utilizing 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract high-level semantic information from raw CT images. This architecture allows for both recognition of key feature interactions and generalization to unseen patterns, providing promising prediction capability in medical fields. In practice, we applied our model to a dataset of 388 non-small cell lung cancer patients, comparing its performance against a random survival forest baseline model. The wide-and-deep model achieved superior predictive accuracy. Compared to the random forest model, the wide-and-deep model demonstrated a much lower integrated Brier score on the test set. Our findings highlight the potential of this innovative approach in enhancing prognostic accuracy in lung cancer prediction, contributing to the growing intersection of artificial intelligence, radiomics, and personalized medicine.
